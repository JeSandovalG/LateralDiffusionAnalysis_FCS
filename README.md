Jupyter notebook containing all the code used to make lateral diffusion coefficient measurements with the Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) method at University of Los Andes without the need of third-party software. <br> The code contains the necessary functions to perform FCS just using the raw fluoresence measurements in a confocal volume (i.e. signal of one pixel in the region of interest).
For this code, we recommend doing at least 20 measurements in different samples in order to ensure low-noise lateral diffusion measurements. For the use of this code, just start from the first cell and keep going down until you calculate the diffusion coefficient. Additional comments can be found in the jupyter notebook.<br><br>
